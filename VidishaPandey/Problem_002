# print sum of numbers from 1 to n, where you take n as input from user
n = int(Input())
print((n*(n+1))/2)

# print sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n, where you take n as input from user
print((n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6)


# print result of adding all even numbers and subtracting all odd numbers from 1 to n, where you take n as input from user
method 1:
if n%2 == 0:
  print(n//2)
else:
  print(-(n+1)//2)

method 2:
print(n//2 - n*(n%2))

# (Optional) now try to solve all problems above without using a loop
